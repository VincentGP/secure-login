# Secure login
This small login example was developed as part of a Web Security elective with the purpose of securing a login form.

To try it out, the files needs to be served by a web server (Apache) and you need to implement the SQL dump included in the project. You will also need to generate a hashed password with the file *generate-password.php* and insert a user (with the password) directly in the database.
